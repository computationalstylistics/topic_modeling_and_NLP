# From texts to topics, with some NLP in between

This repository contains a tutorial on how to train a topic model with R, provided that the input texts require some NLP massaging prior to actual topic modeling. Specifically, lemmatization might be welcome in some languages. With this in mind, the current tutorial covers some basic NLP tasks with the package `udpipe`, followed by training a topic model with the package `topicmodels`. Some cool visualizations using the package `wordclouds` are also briefly discussed!

Check out [the actual tutorial (blog post)](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/blog/topic_modeling_lemmatized/); whereas this repository contains the materials needed to replicate the whole procedure.
